    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Halloween treats are scary enough and tasty enough for kids to love. They are also fairly healthy and the kids may want to get involved in the preparations.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>2 cups powdered milk</li>
        <li>2 cups honey</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) package pretzel rods</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced almonds, or as needed</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup plum jam, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix peanut butter, powdered milk, and honey together in a bowl until mixture resembles a soft dough. This will be the 'flesh' of the fingers.</li>
        <li>Mold enough dough around each pretzel rod, making sure to cover the ends. The pretzels will be the 'bones' of the fingers.</li>
        <li>Use the tip of a teaspoon the make marks on the 'flesh' similar to knuckles.</li>
        <li>Push 1 sliced almond onto 1 end of each 'finger' to resemble a finger nail.</li>
        <li>Place jam in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until softened, 20 to 30 seconds. Dip the end opposite the 'finger nail' into the jam for the 'blood'. </li>
    </ol>
