    <p>Bubble, bubble. Toil and trouble. This appetizer is commonly known and used but, I have put my own little twist on this recipe. It is deviled eggs made to look like the eyeballs of a lizard. It a hit with the kids at my Halloween party. Watch them get eaten up at your party!</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 pinch celery salt</li>
        <li>2 drops green food coloring, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all of the eggs into a large pot so they can rest on the bottom in a single layer. Fill with just enough cold water to cover the eggs. Bring to a boil, then cover, remove from the heat and let stand for about 15 minutes. Rinse under cold water or add some ice to the water and let the eggs cool completely.</li>
        <li>Peel and slice in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks from the eggs and place them in a bowl. Mix in the relish, mayonnaise, celery salt, mustard, and food coloring.</li>
        <li>Spoon this filling into the egg whites and place them on a serving tray. Round the top of the filling using the spoon.</li>
        <li>Place an olive slice on each yolk to create the center of the eye. Dab a tiny bit of mayonnaise in the center of the olive as a finishing touch.</li>
    </ol>
